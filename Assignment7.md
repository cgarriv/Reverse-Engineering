### Summary
- This week we will be observing library injections in action.
- A DLL injection is a technique used for running code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library (DLL).
- This method is often used in malicous attacks that inject malware into legitimate processes to hide malicous actions or gain elevated privallages.

- (This week, I had to come to Colorado for a family emergency.
I unfortunately did not bring my safe lab environment laptop with me.
I will be returning to campus and to my laptop with my VMâ€™s to perform the required analysis for assignment 7 on Wednesday (April 3rd).
Once I preform the required analysis and work for assignment 7 I will update this link with the outlined requirements.)
